##FashionKart is a modern Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to deliver a seamless and engaging e-commerce experience using core front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developed as part of a web development internship project (Task 4), FashionKart mimics real-world online shopping platforms like Meesho and Flipkart by offering dynamic category-based product browsing and offline functionality. The app includes five major product categories—Kurti, Tops, Shirts, Pants, and Shoes—with more than five distinct products in each category. Each product is displayed with a name, price, and image, styled attractively using CSS to ensure a user-friendly interface. When a user selects a category, products load dynamically without page reloads, providing a smooth and responsive experience. Clicking “Add to Cart” updates a live item counter in the footer, which showcases real-time JavaScript interactivity and DOM manipulation. As a fully functional PWA, FashionKart includes a manifest.json file that defines metadata such as the app name, icons, colors, and display mode, enabling users to install the app to their desktop or mobile home screen like a native application. The app also features a registered service-worker.js file which caches essential assets—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and icons—allowing the app to work offline. This was verified through Chrome DevTools, where the service worker is shown as registered and running, and the app continues to load and function even without internet access. An additional push notification simulation feature was implemented using a simple JavaScript alert to imitate real-time promotional alerts, enhancing the feel of a real shopping platform. The design is clean and modern, with responsive layout handling for both mobile and desktop, and button interactions are styled with transitions and hover effects for better user experience. The app is run locally using Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension, allowing testing of all PWA features including installability and offline capability. Users can open the app in their browser, click the install icon in the address bar, and launch it as a standalone application on their device. This project not only demonstrates proficiency in web development but also applies current web standards such as Progressive Web Apps and offline-first design principles. FashionKart provides a practical, real-world implementation of a PWA with dynamic data handling and UI responsiveness. It offers a solid foundation for future enhancements like authentication, cart management, payment integration, and backend connectivity. Overall, FashionKart meets and exceeds the goals of Task 4 by combining clean design, interactivity, and powerful PWA features in a cohesive and efficient shopping application. It is an ideal example of how modern web apps can be built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while delivering native-app-like functionality and user experience. This project serves as both a learning tool and a portfolio-worthy demonstration of the developer’s understanding of progressive enhancement, user-centric design, and front-end development best practices.
